# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Trust Registry on Blockchain
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the blockchain-based trust registry for maintaining records of trusted data providers, dataset quality assessments, community ratings, and compliance certificates.
# Details:
1. Design trust registry data structure:
   - Provider entries schema
   - Dataset verification records
   - Community ratings format
   - Compliance certificates structure
2. Implement blockchain integration with cheqd network:
   - Set up connection to cheqd network
   - Implement transaction submission
   - Create verification methods
3. Develop trust score calculation algorithm:
   - Weight different factors (credentials, ratings, history)
   - Implement score normalization
   - Create update mechanisms
4. Create registry query interface:
   - Search functionality
   - Filtering options
   - Sorting capabilities
5. Implement multi-stakeholder input system:
   - Allow verified ratings from AI developers
   - Include third-party assessments
   - Support self-attestations with verification
6. Create visualization components for trust metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for trust score calculation
2. Integration tests with cheqd blockchain
3. Verify proper recording of trust data
4. Test query performance and accuracy
5. Validate multi-stakeholder input system
6. Verify visualization components
7. Test system resilience to invalid data

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design the Trust Registry Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core data structure for the blockchain-based trust registry
### Details:
Create a comprehensive data schema that includes: entity identifiers, trust attributes, verification status, timestamp fields, cryptographic proof elements, and relationship mappings between entities. The structure must support hierarchical trust relationships and include versioning capabilities. Define the on-chain and off-chain data components, considering GDPR compliance requirements for personal data.

## 2. Implement cheqd Network Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop the integration layer with the cheqd blockchain network
### Details:
Build API connectors to the cheqd network for reading and writing trust registry data. Implement transaction signing and verification using cheqd's cryptographic standards. Create a node connection management system with failover capabilities. Develop the DID resolution mechanism for entity identification. Implement the anchoring process for trust claims on the cheqd ledger with proper gas fee management.

## 3. Develop Trust Score Calculation Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the algorithmic framework for calculating entity trust scores
### Details:
Design a weighted multi-factor trust algorithm incorporating verification status, historical behavior, network attestations, and temporal decay factors. Implement Bayesian trust propagation for network effects. Create configurable risk thresholds and confidence intervals. Develop the mathematical models for trust aggregation across multiple domains. Include anomaly detection capabilities to identify potential trust violations.

## 4. Build Query Interface and API Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Develop the interface for querying trust registry data
### Details:
Create a GraphQL API for complex trust data queries with filtering, pagination, and sorting capabilities. Implement REST endpoints for simpler use cases. Develop query optimization for performance with caching strategies. Build authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access. Create SDK libraries in multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Java) for developer integration. Document the API with OpenAPI specifications.

## 5. Implement Multi-Stakeholder Input System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Description: Create the system for multiple stakeholders to contribute trust data
### Details:
Develop role-based access control for different stakeholder types. Create consensus mechanisms for resolving conflicting trust claims. Implement cryptographic proof of authority for stakeholder contributions. Build governance workflows for trust data disputes. Create audit logging for all trust registry modifications. Implement incentive mechanisms for quality trust attestations.

## 6. Develop Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create interactive visualization tools for trust relationships
### Details:
Build a network graph visualization showing trust relationships between entities. Implement trust score dashboards with historical trends. Create heat maps for identifying trust concentrations and vulnerabilities. Develop comparative visualization tools for entity trust assessment. Build customizable reporting interfaces with export capabilities. Ensure visualizations are responsive across device types with accessibility compliance.
