# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Storage Layer and Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the hybrid storage system using IPFS for decentralized dataset storage and PostgreSQL for relational metadata, with appropriate data models and schemas.
# Details:
1. Set up PostgreSQL database:
   - Create schemas for users, datasets, credentials, and trust registry
   - Implement data models as defined in PRD
   - Set up indexes for efficient querying
   - Configure database security and access controls
2. Integrate IPFS for decentralized storage:
   - Set up IPFS node or use IPFS service provider
   - Implement file upload/download functionality
   - Create content addressing system
   - Implement chunking for large datasets
3. Create data access layer:
   - Implement repository pattern for database access
   - Create services for IPFS interactions
   - Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
4. Develop data migration and backup strategies:
   - Create database migration scripts
   - Implement regular backup procedures
   - Design disaster recovery plan

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for data models and repositories
2. Integration tests for database operations
3. Performance tests for large dataset handling
4. Verify IPFS storage and retrieval functionality
5. Test backup and restore procedures
6. Validate data integrity across storage systems

# Subtasks:
## 1. PostgreSQL Database Setup and Schema Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure PostgreSQL database environment and design normalized schema for application data
### Details:
Install PostgreSQL 14+, configure for high performance (connection pooling, query optimization). Design normalized database schema with proper indexes, constraints, and relationships. Create tables for users, content metadata, permissions, and transaction records. Implement partitioning strategy for large tables. Document schema with ERD diagrams and migration scripts.

## 2. IPFS Integration for Decentralized Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement IPFS node connection and content addressing system for storing large binary data
### Details:
Set up IPFS node (go-ipfs or js-ipfs), configure for production use with appropriate garbage collection policies. Develop content addressing system to store and retrieve binary data (images, videos, documents). Create content identifier (CID) mapping system in PostgreSQL. Implement pinning service integration for persistence. Add encryption layer for sensitive content with key management.

## 3. Data Access Layer Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create unified API for accessing data across PostgreSQL and IPFS storage systems
### Details:
Develop repository pattern implementation with interfaces for data access. Create data models and DTOs for application layer. Implement caching strategy using Redis for frequently accessed data. Build query optimization for complex data retrieval operations. Create transaction management for operations spanning both storage systems. Implement connection pooling and retry mechanisms for resilience.

## 4. Data Migration and Backup Strategy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive data migration, backup and disaster recovery processes
### Details:
Create automated backup system for PostgreSQL (WAL archiving, point-in-time recovery). Implement IPFS content pinning strategy across multiple nodes for redundancy. Develop data migration scripts for schema evolution. Create disaster recovery procedures with documented RTO/RPO metrics. Implement monitoring and alerting for storage system health. Set up periodic integrity checks for IPFS content verification.
