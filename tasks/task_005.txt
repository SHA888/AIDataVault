# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Dataset Upload and Metadata Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality for data providers to upload datasets, generate DIDs for datasets, and manage comprehensive metadata including quality metrics, ethics assessments, and usage policies.
# Details:
1. Implement dataset upload functionality:
   - Multi-format support (CSV, JSON, PARQUET, etc.)
   - Chunking for large files
   - Progress tracking
   - Validation of file integrity
2. Generate DIDs for datasets:
   - Integrate with cheqd for DID creation
   - Link dataset to DID
   - Create DID-Linked Resources for metadata
3. Implement metadata management:
   - Create forms for metadata input based on W3C DCAT vocabulary
   - Validate metadata completeness
   - Store metadata in PostgreSQL
4. Develop quality metrics collection:
   - Basic statistical analysis of datasets
   - Format validation
   - Completeness checks
5. Implement ethics assessment tools:
   - Consent verification
   - Privacy impact assessment
   - Bias detection helpers
6. Create usage policy and pricing interface:
   - Define access controls
   - Set pricing models
   - Specify usage limitations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for metadata validation
2. Integration tests for dataset upload process
3. Verify DID generation and linking
4. Test large file handling and chunking
5. Validate quality metrics calculation
6. Test ethics assessment tools accuracy
7. Verify proper storage of datasets in IPFS

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement secure file upload system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust file upload component that handles multiple data formats, validates files, and integrates with storage systems
### Details:
Develop a file upload system supporting CSV, JSON, and common ML dataset formats. Implement client-side validation for file size/type, chunked uploading for large files, progress indicators, and secure storage integration. Include error handling for failed uploads and resumable upload capability. Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks before upload.

## 2. Develop DID generation and management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a system to generate and manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for uploaded datasets
### Details:
Implement DID generation following W3C standards. Create unique identifiers for each dataset with proper versioning support. Develop resolver functionality to retrieve datasets via DIDs. Implement cryptographic verification of dataset integrity using the DID. Design a storage system for DID documents with proper indexing for efficient retrieval. Include functionality to update and manage DID documents as datasets evolve.

## 3. Build comprehensive metadata management interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create a user interface and backend system for capturing, storing, and retrieving dataset metadata
### Details:
Develop a schema for dataset metadata including creator information, creation date, update history, data types, and domain-specific attributes. Create form interfaces for metadata entry with validation. Implement metadata extraction from common file formats. Design a search and filter system for metadata. Include version control for metadata changes. Ensure metadata is linked to DIDs correctly.

## 4. Implement data quality metrics collection and display [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Create systems to analyze datasets for quality metrics and display these metrics to users
### Details:
Implement automated quality assessment for completeness, consistency, and accuracy. Create visualizations for quality metrics including missing value analysis, outlier detection, and statistical summaries. Develop a scoring system for overall dataset quality. Include recommendations for quality improvements. Design a dashboard to display quality metrics with drill-down capabilities. Ensure metrics are stored with dataset metadata.

## 5. Develop ethics assessment tools and interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create tools to evaluate ethical considerations of datasets and interfaces to display and manage these assessments
### Details:
Implement bias detection algorithms for common dataset types. Create questionnaires for dataset creators to assess ethical implications. Develop visualization tools for bias and fairness metrics. Include documentation templates for ethical considerations. Design review workflows for ethical assessments. Create an ethics score or rating system with explanations. Ensure all ethics data is stored with dataset metadata.

## 6. Create usage policy management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.5
### Description: Develop interfaces and backend systems for defining, storing, and enforcing dataset usage policies
### Details:
Implement a policy definition language for dataset usage restrictions. Create user interfaces for policy creation with templates for common scenarios. Develop policy enforcement mechanisms that integrate with access control systems. Include audit logging for policy compliance. Design machine-readable policy formats compatible with automated systems. Create visualization tools for understanding policy implications. Ensure policies are cryptographically linked to DIDs for verification.
