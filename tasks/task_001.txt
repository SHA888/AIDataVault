# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React.js/Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and configure cloud infrastructure on AWS/Azure/GCP with CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
1. Create a monorepo structure with separate directories for frontend and backend
2. Frontend setup:
   - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up component directory structure
   - Implement responsive layout with dark mode support
3. Backend setup:

   - Set up API route structure
   - Configure middleware for authentication, logging, etc.
4. Infrastructure:
   - Set up cloud resources (compute, storage, networking)
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Implement Docker containers for consistent environments
   - Set up monitoring and logging services
5. Documentation:
   - Create README with setup instructions
   - Document architecture decisions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful build process for both frontend and backend
2. Test deployment pipeline with a simple Hello World application
3. Validate environment variables and configuration management
4. Verify monitoring and logging functionality
5. Run security scanning on initial infrastructure
