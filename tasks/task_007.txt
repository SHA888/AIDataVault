Build search input with autocomplete suggestions. Implement multi-parameter filtering (by category, date, size, format, etc). Create sorting mechanisms (relevance, date, popularity). Develop faceted search with dynamic aggregations. Implement search history and saved searches. Optimize query performance with debouncing and caching strategies. Add support for advanced query syntax for power users.

## 3. Create Dataset Evaluation Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Build interactive tools for users to preview and evaluate datasets before acquisition
### Details:
Develop data preview components for various file formats (CSV, JSON, images). Implement statistical summary visualizations (histograms, distributions). Create sample data viewers with pagination. Build metadata inspection panels showing schema information. Add data quality indicators and completeness metrics. Implement comparison tools for multiple datasets. Create interactive data exploration features with basic querying capabilities.

## 4. Implement Responsive Design System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Ensure marketplace interface works seamlessly across all device types and screen sizes
### Details:
Create responsive grid layouts using CSS Grid/Flexbox. Implement adaptive components that transform based on viewport size. Develop touch-friendly interactions for mobile users. Optimize image loading with responsive images and lazy loading. Create device-specific navigation patterns (hamburger menu for mobile). Implement responsive data tables with horizontal scrolling or card views. Test and optimize for various breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop, large displays).

## 5. Design User Experience Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create comprehensive user journeys for dataset discovery, evaluation, and acquisition
### Details:
Map user journey from search to dataset acquisition. Implement guided onboarding for new users. Create personalized recommendation system based on user behavior. Design notification system for dataset updates or new matches. Implement user feedback collection mechanisms. Create dashboard for tracking dataset usage and history.
