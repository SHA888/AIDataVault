   - Push notifications for mobile
   - Notification preferences management
2. Create notification types:
   - Transaction alerts
   - Dataset updates
   - New dataset availability
   - Feedback received
   - System announcements
3. Ensure system integration:
   - End-to-end testing of user flows
   - API consistency verification
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling standardization
4. Implement system health monitoring:
   - Real-time system health dashboard
   - Performance tracking
   - Error logging and alerting
   - Usage statistics
5. Create documentation:
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - System architecture documentation
   - Maintenance procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for notification generation
2. Integration tests for notification delivery
3. End-to-end tests for complete user flows
4. Performance testing under load
5. Verify proper error handling across system
6. Test system monitoring accuracy
7. Validate documentation completeness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement notification service core [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core notification service with a flexible architecture that supports multiple notification types and delivery channels
### Details:
Implement a notification service that uses a publisher-subscriber pattern. Create interfaces for notification providers (email, SMS, push, in-app).

Develop integration with user preference system to respect notification settings. Create notification batching for bulk operations. Implement webhook support for third-party system integration.

## 4. Implement notification health monitoring and analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create monitoring and analytics for the notification system to track performance and delivery statistics
### Details:
Implement delivery status tracking (sent, delivered, failed, opened). Create dashboard for notification analytics with delivery rates and engagement metrics. Set up alerting for notification service failures. Implement logging for all notification activities. Create performance metrics collection for notification processing times and queue lengths.

## 5. Create documentation and testing for notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation and testing suite for the notification system
### Details:
Create API documentation for notification service endpoints. Write developer guides for adding new notification types. Develop end-to-end tests for notification delivery. Implement load testing for high-volume notification scenarios. Create user documentation for notification preferences and settings. Document integration points with other system components.
