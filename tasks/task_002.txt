# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement DID-based Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the authentication service using DIDs on the cheqd network for secure user registration, login, and identity management for both data providers and AI developers.
# Details:
1. Integrate with cheqd API for DID creation and management
2. Implement user registration flow:
   - Generate DID for new users
   - Store DID and public credentials in database
   - Create user profile with basic information
3. Implement authentication flow:
   - DID-based challenge-response authentication
   - JWT token issuance for session management
   - Refresh token mechanism
4. Create user profile management:
   - Update profile information
   - Manage credentials
   - View reputation metrics
5. Implement role-based access control for data providers vs. AI developers
6. Add security measures:
   - Rate limiting
   - Brute force protection
   - Session management

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication logic
2. Integration tests with cheqd API
3. End-to-end tests for registration and login flows
4. Security testing including penetration testing
5. Performance testing for authentication endpoints
6. Verify proper error handling for invalid credentials

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design DID Architecture and cheqd API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall DID architecture and establish integration with cheqd API for DID operations
### Details:
Create a technical specification document outlining: DID method selection, DID document structure, resolution mechanisms, and cheqd API endpoints mapping. Implement API client for cheqd integration with proper error handling and response parsing. Set up development environment with required dependencies and test connectivity with cheqd network.

## 2. Implement User Registration Flow with DID Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the user registration process that creates and associates DIDs with new user accounts
### Details:
Build registration endpoint that collects required user information. Implement DID creation process using cheqd API. Design database schema for storing user-DID associations. Create verification process for DID ownership. Implement proper error handling for failed DID creation scenarios and develop rollback mechanisms.

## 3. Develop Authentication Mechanism Using DIDs [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create the authentication system that verifies DID ownership and issues secure session tokens
### Details:
Implement challenge-response authentication flow using DID signatures. Develop JWT or similar token issuance system with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms. Create login endpoints that validate DID credentials. Implement session management with secure storage considerations. Add rate limiting and brute force protection mechanisms.

## 4. Build User Profile Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Develop functionality for users to manage their profile information linked to their DID
### Details:
Create profile CRUD operations with proper authentication checks. Implement DID document updates when relevant profile information changes. Design and implement profile data schema with privacy considerations. Add profile verification mechanisms for enhanced trust. Develop profile recovery processes in case of lost DID access.

## 5. Implement Access Control System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Develop role-based access control integrated with DID authentication
### Details:
Design permission model with roles and capabilities. Implement authorization middleware that validates permissions against authenticated DIDs. Create admin interfaces for permission management. Develop audit logging for access control decisions. Implement context-aware access control for different application areas.

## 6. Implement Security Measures and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Add security enhancements and comprehensive testing for the DID authentication system
### Details:
Implement key rotation mechanisms for DIDs. Add multi-factor authentication options. Conduct penetration testing on the authentication flow. Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests. Create security documentation including threat models. Implement monitoring for suspicious authentication activities. Conduct performance testing under various load conditions.
