# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Verifiable Credentials System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the system for issuing, managing, and verifying credentials for data providers and datasets, including identity, attribute, quality, and consent verification credentials.
# Details:
1. Integrate with cheqd API for credential issuance and verification
2. Implement credential schemas based on W3C standards:
   - Provider identity credentials
   - Dataset attribute credentials
   - Quality assessment credentials
   - Consent verification credentials
3. Create credential issuance flows:
   - For provider identity verification
   - For dataset attributes and quality
   - For consent verification
4. Implement verification engine:
   - Credential validation logic
   - Revocation checking
   - Trust chain verification
5. Create credential management UI:
   - View issued credentials
   - Request new credentials
   - Manage credential visibility
6. Implement credential storage and retrieval

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for credential validation logic
2. Integration tests with cheqd credential API
3. Test credential issuance and verification flows
4. Verify proper handling of invalid or revoked credentials
5. Performance testing for verification operations
6. Security testing for credential storage

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement cheqd API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop integration with cheqd network for DID operations and credential anchoring
### Details:
Create API client for cheqd network, implement DID creation/resolution methods, handle key management for signing operations, implement transaction submission for anchoring credentials, add error handling and retry mechanisms, and create comprehensive test suite for API interactions.

## 2. Develop Credential Schema Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create schema definition system compliant with W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model
### Details:
Design JSON-LD context definitions, implement schema validation utilities, create schema registry with versioning support, develop schema transformation tools for different formats (JWT, JSON-LD), and build schema visualization components for the management UI.

## 3. Build Credential Issuance Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Implement secure credential issuance flow with signing and anchoring capabilities
### Details:
Create credential template system, implement cryptographic signing module using EdDSA/ECDSA, develop credential status registry integration, build batch issuance capabilities, implement revocation mechanisms, and create comprehensive logging for audit trails.

## 4. Develop Verification Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create verification system for credential validation and trust chain verification
### Details:
Implement signature verification module, build trust chain validation logic, create revocation checking system, develop timestamp validation, implement schema conformance checking, and create pluggable verification policy framework for different credential types.

## 5. Create Credential Management UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Build user interface for credential issuance, verification, and management
### Details:
Design credential template editor, implement credential issuance workflow UI, create verification results visualization, build credential explorer with filtering capabilities, develop schema management interface, and implement user permission system for credential operations.

## 6. Implement Secure Storage and Retrieval System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Develop encrypted storage and efficient retrieval mechanisms for credentials
### Details:
Design encrypted data model for credential storage, implement indexing for efficient queries, create backup and recovery mechanisms, develop access control layer, implement caching strategy for frequently accessed credentials, and build comprehensive API for credential CRUD operations.
