   - Create balance checking functionality
   - Handle transaction receipts
2. Develop payment flows:
   - Dataset purchase process
   - Subscription models
   - Escrow for quality guarantees
   - Refund mechanisms
3. Implement access control system:
   - Generate access tokens for purchased datasets
   - Time-limited access implementation
   - Usage tracking
   - Access revocation capabilities
4. Create provider payout system:
   - Earnings dashboard
   - Withdrawal functionality
   - Transaction history
   - Tax reporting tools
5. Implement pricing models:
   - One-time purchase
   - Subscription-based
   - Usage-based
   - Tiered access levels

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for payment processing logic
2. Integration tests with CHEQ token system
3. Test access control enforcement
4. Verify proper handling of payment edge cases
5. Security testing for access mechanisms
6. Performance testing for concurrent access
7. Test provider payout system accuracy
