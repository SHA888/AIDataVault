# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Economic Incentive Model and Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the token-based incentive system that rewards high-quality, ethical data provision, along with analytics dashboards for providers and developers.
# Details:
1. Design and implement incentive model:
   - Quality-based rewards
   - Usage-based incentives
   - Positive feedback rewards
   - Early provider bonuses
2. Create analytics dashboard for providers:
   - Dataset usage statistics
   - Revenue tracking
   - Quality metrics over time
   - Comparison with marketplace averages
3. Implement developer analytics:
   - Dataset performance metrics
   - Value assessment tools
   - Usage tracking
   - ROI calculations
4. Develop feedback and rating system:
   - Star ratings
   - Detailed reviews
   - Issue reporting
   - Resolution tracking
5. Implement reputation system:
   - Calculate provider reputation scores
   - Track historical performance
   - Visualize reputation metrics
   - Create incentives for reputation building

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for incentive calculations
2. Integration tests for analytics data collection
3. Verify accuracy of statistical calculations
4. Test dashboard performance with large datasets
5. Validate feedback system functionality
6. Test reputation score calculations
7. Verify proper incentive distribution

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement the core incentive model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the economic incentive model that will drive provider participation and quality service delivery
### Details:
Develop mathematical models for token distribution, implement smart contracts for automated payments, create reward tiers based on service quality and volume, design penalty mechanisms for service failures, and implement simulation tools to test model effectiveness under various conditions. Include documentation of model parameters and formulas.

## 2. Develop provider analytics dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build a comprehensive analytics dashboard for service providers to track their performance and earnings
### Details:
Implement real-time data visualization components, create earnings tracking with historical trends, develop service usage metrics, implement performance comparisons against platform averages, build forecasting tools for future earnings, and ensure mobile responsiveness with exportable reports.

## 3. Create developer analytics system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement analytics tools for developers to monitor API usage, costs, and performance metrics
### Details:
Build API call tracking and visualization, implement cost analysis tools with budget alerts, create performance metrics for response times and availability, develop usage pattern analysis, implement anomaly detection for unusual activity, and create integration with common development environments.

## 4. Implement feedback and rating system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design and build a comprehensive feedback and rating system for service quality assessment
### Details:
Create multi-dimensional rating criteria (speed, accuracy, reliability), implement user interfaces for feedback collection, develop algorithms for detecting fraudulent ratings, build notification systems for feedback alerts, implement response mechanisms for providers, and create analytics for rating trends over time.

## 5. Develop reputation scoring system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.4
### Description: Create an algorithmic reputation system that synthesizes multiple data points into provider reputation scores
### Details:
Implement weighted scoring algorithms incorporating multiple factors (ratings, uptime, response time, etc.), create decay functions for time-sensitive reputation factors, develop visualization of reputation components, implement reputation level thresholds with benefits, create appeals process for disputed scores, and build documentation explaining the reputation calculation methodology.
