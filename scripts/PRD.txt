# Overview  
AI DataVault is a decentralized marketplace for AI training data that leverages blockchain technology to solve critical trust issues in AI development. It enables AI developers to discover, verify, and access ethical datasets with proven provenance, clear consent mechanisms, and quality guarantees. The platform addresses the growing concern that AI systems are only as good as the data they're trained on, providing a solution to verify dataset origins, quality, and ethical collection practices.

# Core Features  
## Verified Data Provider Identity
- **What it does**: Creates and verifies digital identities for data providers using DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and verifiable credentials.
- **Why it's important**: Establishes trust in who is providing the data, allowing AI developers to make informed decisions based on provider reputation.
- **How it works**: Providers register and receive a DID on the cheqd network, along with verifiable credentials that attest to their identity and qualifications.

## Dataset DID and Metadata
- **What it does**: Assigns a unique DID to each dataset with linked metadata through DID-Linked Resources.
- **Why it's important**: Creates a permanent, tamper-proof record of dataset characteristics and provenance.
- **How it works**: When uploading datasets, the system generates a DID and attaches standardized metadata including collection methodology, consent status, and quality metrics.

## Trust Registry
- **What it does**: Maintains a blockchain-based registry of trusted data providers and dataset quality assessments.
- **Why it's important**: Provides a decentralized mechanism for verifying the trustworthiness of datasets.
- **How it works**: Multiple stakeholders contribute to trust scores, and the collective assessment is recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

## Marketplace Discovery and Access
- **What it does**: Enables AI developers to search, evaluate, and access datasets with clear quality indicators.
- **Why it's important**: Simplifies the process of finding appropriate, high-quality datasets for specific AI training needs.
- **How it works**: A user-friendly interface with advanced filters allows developers to browse datasets and see transparent metrics before purchase.

## Economic Incentive Model
- **What it does**: Rewards high-quality, ethical data provision through a token-based system.
- **Why it's important**: Creates financial incentives for maintaining high standards in dataset creation and documentation.
- **How it works**: Providers earn CHEQ tokens based on dataset quality, usage, and positive feedback from AI developers.
