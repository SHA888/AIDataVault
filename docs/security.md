## 1. Authentication and Authorization

-   **Mechanism:** User authentication is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    -   Upon successful login (`POST /api/auth/login`), a JWT is issued to the client.
    -   This token must be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for accessing protected routes (e.g., `GET /api/users/profile`).
-   **Token Generation:** JWTs are generated using a secret key (`JWT_SECRET` defined in `/server/.env`) and include user identifiers and an expiration time (`JWT_EXPIRES_IN`).
-   **Token Verification:** Protected routes use middleware (`authenticateToken` in `server/src/utils/jwtUtils.js`) to verify the token's validity and signature.
-   **Future Enhancements:** Role-based access control (RBAC) can be implemented if different user roles require varying levels of access to resources.

## 2. Data Protection

### Password Security

-   **Hashing:** User passwords are not stored in plaintext. They are hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, as typically implemented in `server/src/utils/passwordUtils.js` via `hashPassword` and `comparePassword`).
-   **Salt:** Salting is an integral part of modern password hashing libraries like bcrypt and is employed to protect against rainbow table attacks.

### Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities

While not exhaustively audited, general best practices are encouraged:

-   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The use of an ORM (Sequelize) helps mitigate SQLi risks by parameterizing queries. Direct construction of SQL queries from user input should be avoided.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** For any part of the application that renders user-supplied data on a frontend (not detailed in current backend scope), appropriate output encoding and content sanitization techniques must be used.
-   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** For web applications with session-based authentication, CSRF tokens would be necessary. For API-based authentication using JWTs in headers, CSRF is generally less of a direct concern, but browser storage of tokens needs care (e.g., HttpOnly cookies for web contexts if applicable).

## 3. Input Validation

-   **Server-Side Validation:** Incoming data from requests (e.g., request bodies, URL parameters) is validated on the server side before processing.
    -   Example: The `/api/auth/register` route checks for the presence of `username`, `email`, and `password`.
    -   Sequelize models also provide schema-level validation (e.g., data types, constraints).
-   **Importance:** Robust input validation helps prevent malformed data, injection attacks, and unexpected application behavior.

## 4. Secrets Management

-   **Environment Variables:** Sensitive information such as database credentials (`DATABASE_URL`), `JWT_SECRET`, and external API keys (`CHEQD_API_KEY`) are managed through environment variables.
-   **`.env` File:** For local development, these variables are stored in the `/server/.env` file. This file is gitignored (via `/server/.gitignore`) to prevent accidental commitment of secrets to the repository.
-   **Production:** In production environments, environment variables should be injected securely through the deployment platform's mechanisms (e.g., CI/CD variables, platform-specific secret stores).
-   **Docker:** The `docker-compose.yml` file references environment variables from `.env` for the database service initialization and passes them to the application container.

## 5. Dependency Management

-   **Regular Updates:** Project dependencies (listed in `server/package.json`) should be regularly reviewed and updated to their latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
-   **Security Audits:** Tools like `npm audit` or GitHub Dependabot alerts should be used to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
-   **SonarCloud:** The CI/CD pipeline includes SonarCloud scans, which can help identify security hotspots and vulnerabilities in the codebase itself as well as in dependencies.

## 6. Decentralized Identity (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC)

*(This section will require more specific details based on the project's implementation of DID/VC features.)*

-   **Objective:** AIDataVault aims to integrate DIDs and VCs for enhanced user and dataset authentication and verification.
-   **Considerations:**
    -   Secure storage and handling of private keys associated with DIDs.
    -   Validation of VCs according to relevant specifications (e.g., W3C VC Data Model).
    -   Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of presented credentials.
    -   Privacy implications of handling DID/VC data.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Security

-   **Secrets in CI/CD:** Secrets used in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., SonarCloud tokens, deployment credentials) should be stored as encrypted secrets within the CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions secrets).
-   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The CI/CD pipeline should only have the permissions necessary to perform its tasks.
-   **Code Scanning:** The pipeline integrates SonarCloud for static analysis, which helps detect potential security vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.

## 8. Compliance Considerations

*(This section will depend heavily on the nature of the data handled and the target operational environment. For a local development focus, it's more about awareness.)*

-   **Data Privacy:** If the application handles Personally Identifiable Information (PII), relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) must be considered, especially regarding data collection, storage, access, and user rights.
-   **Data Residency:** If data needs to be stored in specific geographic locations.
-   **Specific Industry Standards:** If the application is intended for a specific industry (e.g., healthcare with HIPAA), those standards would apply.

This document provides a high-level overview. Security is an ongoing process, and this document should be updated as the project evolves and new security measures are implemented or threats identified.
